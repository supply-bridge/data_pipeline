# üìÑ Raw Data Processing & Capability Extraction Pipeline ‚Äì Table Structure & Data Flow Design (Proposal)

------

## Principles for Capability-Structure Design

The future automated clustering and classification process will **not discard the existing** **offering_tree** **structure**, but instead build upon it.

- New candidate capability segments **must first attempt to attach to the current tree**.
- Unattachable segments may be clustered into an ‚Äúout-of-structure node candidate pool‚Äù for manual review and future structure extension.
- This preserves semantic consistency, avoids fragmentation, and supports recommendation, search, and agent reasoning.

------

## 1. `raw_data`

| Field       | Type     | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | PK       | Primary key                                        |
| supplier_id | FK       | Supplier ID                                        |
| source_type | varchar  | Exposure type (web, pdf, manual_upload, etc.)      |
| content     | text     | Extracted full-text content                        |
| parsed_at   | datetime | Extraction timestamp                               |
| processed   | boolean  | Whether it has been processed                      |
| batch_id    | varchar  | Batch ID for incremental processing identification |

**Data flow**:

- **Source**: crawlers, upload services, integrations, etc.
- **Destination**: Inputs into chunking and structured extraction pipelines.

------

## 2. `text_chunks`

These store raw semantic fragments. They are subject to **heuristic filtering** (e.g. labeling chunk types) but not embedding or capability matching. They feed all downstream structured extraction tasks (e.g. contact_info, certification).

| Field                  | Type     | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id                     | PK       | Primary key                                                  |
| raw_data_id            | FK       | Reference to `raw_data.id`                                   |
| chunk_index            | int      | Position within the original text (optional)                 |
| text                   | text     | Raw text segment                                             |
| cleaned_text           | text     | Denoised text                                                |
| chunk_type             | varchar  | e.g. general, capability_candidate, contact_info, company_intro, certifications_info, others |
| embedding_processed_at | datetime | Timestamp of embedding completion (for incremental detection) |
| is_noise               | boolean  | Whether marked as noise                                      |

**Data flow**:

- **Source**: splits of `raw_data.content`.
- **Destination**: capability mounting, clustering, search, and more.

**Design logic**:

- Filter out noise (e.g. contact info or low-value text) early.
- Separate structured segments (capabilities, contacts, intros, certifications) for specialized handling.
- Group all other text under ‚Äúothers‚Äù for embedding and contextual reasoning.
- New structured tables may be created if common ‚Äúothers‚Äù patterns emerge.
- Store `raw_data_filter_log` for audit/debug of chunk filtering.

------

## 3. `capability_candidates`

Holds segments likely indicating capabilities‚Äîfiltered via rules/models.

| Field                | Type              | Description                           |

| id                   | PK                | Primary key                           |
| chunk_id             | FK to text_chunks | Reference segment                     |

| embedding_version    | text              | Embedding model version               |
| created_at           | timestamp         | Creation time                         |
| last_updated_at      | timestamp         | Last update time                      |

**Flow**:

- **Source**: from `text_chunks` via rule/model filters.
- **Purpose**: reduce embedding/classification volume.
- **Output**: candidates for modeling or manual promotion to `capability_mappings`.

------

## Incremental Processing Workflow

1. **Insert new `raw_data`** with batch_id.
2. **Split into `text_chunks`** via a scheduled job.
3. **Embed new chunks**, store vector and timestamp.
4. **Filter for capability candidates** using embeddings + heuristics.
5. **Map candidates to capability tree**, writing `capability_mappings` and updating `supplier_capabilities`.
6. **Use batch_id and processed flags/timestamps** for idempotence and incremental runs.

------

## Dynamic Expansion Mechanism

To extend structured info from ‚Äúothers‚Äù, include:

1. **Monitoring & Statistics Table**: `others_info_stats`, tracking keyword clusters and frequency.
2. **Auto/semi-auto Triggers**: Flag clusters meeting thresholds for structure.
3. **Table Creation & Sync**: Propose new structured tables; optionally migrate data.
4. **Iterative Optimization**: As new tables form, refine structures and field boundaries.

### Example Stats Table

| Field               | Type      | Description                           |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| id                  | bigint    | Primary key                           |
| keyword_cluster_id  | bigint    | Cluster/category ID                   |
| keyword_set         | text[]    | Representative keyword set            |
| occurrence_count    | integer   | Frequency in ‚Äúothers‚Äù                 |
| last_updated        | timestamp | Last update time                      |
| structure_suggested | boolean   | Whether structured table is suggested |
| created_table_name  | text      | Created table‚Äôs name (if generated)   |

------

## Future Automatic Clustering Philosophy

- Automated clustering complements‚Äînot replaces‚Äîthe `offering_tree`.
- Helps discover fine-grained nodes not currently in the tree.
- Enhances matching, reasoning, recommendations via semantic anchor continuity.
- Clustering results guide tree evolution and refinement.

------

## Additional Notes

- Use models like `text-embedding-3-small` for vector generation.
- Consider scheduling via Airflow or similar DAG-based systems.
- Maintain traceability: from `supplier_capabilities` back to `raw_data`.
- Granularity masks support explainable model decisions.
- Filter logs help auditing and quality control.

------

## Appendix A: Supplier-to-Product Node Mapping & Semantic Extension

Many suppliers tie to broader product categories rather than leaf nodes. To formalize this:

- Add `coverage_type` to supplier-offering relationship:
  - **leaf**: default‚Äîsupplier covers just the exact node.
  - **group**: indicates supplier covers that node **and all sub-nodes**.

Benefits:

- Clarifies historical intent without changing schema.
- Enables agents to infer group-level coverage.
- Compatible with legacy data (default to leaf).
- Avoids bloating supplier tables with type logic.

**Example**: If a supplier maps to ‚ÄúPower Assembly‚Äù node with `coverage_type=group`, it implicitly covers all subcategories like batteries and converters. Queries for ‚Äúbattery‚Äù should retrieve this supplier accordingly.

------

## Appendix B: Handling Out-of-Structure Node Requests & Manual Review Workflow

### 1. Background

Suppliers may request mapping to non-existent structure nodes. Ignoring or auto-mapping these is risky. Hence, we introduce a candidate pool + clustering + manual review approach.

### 2. Candidate Pool

- Unmatched mappings go to a candidate pool.
- Similar requests are semantically clustered.
- Clusters feed suggestions for tree extension, subject to human approval.

### 3. Manual Review Logic

Not all candidates require review:

- Auto-map if certain rules/trust thresholds are met.
- Else, push to candidate pool.

Rule examples:

- Semantic similarity below threshold.
- Low supplier credibility.
- Novel or missing capability domains.

### 4. Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Supplier mapping request] --> B[Try matching existing tree]
    B --> C{Matched?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Auto-map]
    C -- No --> E{Eligible for auto-map?}
    E -- Yes --> D
    E -- No --> F[Add to candidate pool]
    F --> G[Cluster analysis]
    G --> H[Manual review]
    H --> I{Approved?}
    I -- Yes --> J[Update offering_tree mapping]
    I -- No --> K[Pending or reject]
```

Steps:

1. Submit request ‚Üí Try simple match.
2. If failed, check auto-map eligibility.
3. If auto-eligible ‚Üí map; if not ‚Üí pool + clustering.
4. Manual review ‚Üí decide mapping or reject.

## Appendix C: Future Iteration

- **Active learning**: Use manual confirmations to re-train models.
- Implement a **weighted confidence and granularity system** to inform models and agents better.
